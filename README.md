## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me get some more practice with changing themes via CSS custom
proprerties, manipulating the DOM with Javascript, and using regex to text input and make sure it fit certain criteria (such as only one decimal point in an operand).

### Continued development

I plan to spend some time learning how to best refactor my code to make it more readable. I will also be working on using git branches more to help with version control, especially as I make potentially breaking changes that may need to be rolled back.
